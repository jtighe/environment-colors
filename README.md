# Environment Colors
Color Scheme for my shell, terminal etc.
* * *
This is based on Wes Bos's [Cobalt2-item Git Hub Repo](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm) and his excellant [Command Line Power User Video Series](http://http://commandlinepoweruser.com/)

cobalt2.zsh-theme is the prompt layout for zsh users.
.minttyrc is for the Cygwin Terminal emulator

For the record, I use the [Babun](http://babun.github.io/) for my Windows shell

You will need to install the patched powerline font as well: https://github.com/powerline/fonts

below is per Wes's git repo mentioned above
## Step-by-step installation

Drop the cobalt2.zsh-theme file in to the ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/ directory.
Open up your ZSH preferences at ~/.zshrc and change the theme variable to ZSH_THEME="cobalt2".
Install 'Inconsolata for Powerline'. (Refer to the powerline-fonts repo for help on font installation.)
Replace the ~/.minttyrc file with the .minttyrc file in this repo.
Restart your terminal.
